				Who am I? <span class="text-muted"> A person of the world.</span>
			</h2>
			<p>This website is here as a way of expressing myself and
				becoming part of the wider world. I would like to use this website
				as an outlet for my thoughts and any creative inclinations that I
				may get.</p>
			<p>For as long as I can remember I have been a Star Trek fan. I
				was fascinated about this future vision of humanity and part of me
				has always wanted to see us pull together and work as a unified
				species.</p>
			<p>After overcoming many obstacles in my life, I have finally
				found myself in a position to voice my opinions and work towards a
				future that I would like to see. I am a PhD student at the
				University of Strathclyde where I research Artificial Intelligence
				(AI) using Video Games. Someone has to make a Commander Data one
				day!</p>

			<p>On a more serious note, my work focuses on developing
				techniques for creating AI which can solve problems for which they
				were not explicitly designed to solve.</p>
			<p>When we develop AI today, we design it to solve a single
				problem. Chess, Go, Cleaning a room. These are all single problems,
				and we can invest our own knowledge of the subject into the AI in
				order to assist in creating a good solution. My feeling is that it
				would be so much cooler if an AI could figure out how to tackle a
				problem without any input from a user at all!</p>
			<p>
				Using Video Games, and an online framework available at <a
					href="http://www.gvgai.net">GVGAI</a>, I have been able to develop
				an AI which can play (theoretically!) any video game. Unfortunately
				it still doesn't very well at certain games, and this is where my
				continued research is focused.
