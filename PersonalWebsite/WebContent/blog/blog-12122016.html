					<p>Hello everyone,</p>
					<p>Recently I have been having a lot of trouble getting to
						work. It is just so easy to do anything else, even if it is worse
						than doing your job.</p>
					<p>I should probably start this by introducing myself. My name
						is Damien (sometimes Damorin) and I am a research student at the
						Universtiy of Strathclyde for the Computer and Information
						Sciences department. My research is in the area of Artificial
						Intelligence (AI) and video games. The work I do looks at
						developing a method of creating AI which can solve unknown
						problems. I could go into this for quite a while, but that is not
						the point of today's post.</p>
					<p>
						Today I want to focus a bit on my challenge in getting to work.
						How can I have an interesting and extremely fun project to work
						on, and yet procrastinate constantly? The answer is me. I am my
						own boss, and that does not appear to be wise. So I decided to
						create a new boss, as I am incompetent at it. That boss is <b>you</b>,
						the world. I want to create these blog posts to be accountable, to
						shout my intent to the world and hopefully feel guilty when I
						don't get enough work done.
					</p>
					<p>Thank you for accepting this position of responsibility.
						Perhaps I can blame you going forward.</p>
					<p>Each monday I will post on here with a plan of action. An
						overview of what I hope to achieve for the week. At the end of the
						week on Friday I will give an honest evaluation of how much I have
						achieved. I have put together a sort of work board in front of my
						desk to also constantly judge me.</p>
					<p>This may seem a little sadistic, but my work is important to
						me. I would not feel right to not give it the fullest of my
						attention and so far it has been easy to read papers, facebook
						posts, go for a walk, look longingly at that cake. I need to
						focus, and I hope that this will help me to do so.</p>
					<p>Thanks for listening, hopefully today is truly a fresh new
						start.</p>
					<p>Damien/Damorin</p>
					<p>P.S. I may also use this blog to rant, but that is a given
						yeah?</p>
