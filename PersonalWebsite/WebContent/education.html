			<h3>2016</h3>
			<p>
				<b>John Mather's Rising Star Award</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				This award gave me the funding in order to have some pretty awesome research
				away trips to the University of Essex, New York University and to a summer school in
				Bilbao. I met some incredible people on these trips and it was all thanks to the Â£10k
				award that I was lucky enough to win. It boosted the value of my PhD immeasurably.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Robertson Medal</b>
			</p>
			<p>I won this award based on the PhD proposal put together for
				the Carnegie Trust PhD scholarship. It was a tremendous honour to
				win this, and a massive shock to say the least!</p>

			<h3>2015</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Carnegie Trust PhD Scholarship</b>
			</p>
			<p>Due to my academic record, time working with CERN and my
				success with the final year project, I was awarded a Carnegie PhD
				scholarship to carry on my research at a doctoral level. The day I
				got this was one of my happiest, as it truly felt that I was on the
				path that I had wanted to be on for a long time. At last!</p>
			<p>
				<b>Charles Babbage Award</b>
			</p>
			<p>Awarded to the student with the best final year project in the
				CIS department.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Young Software Engineer of the Year Award - Third Place</b>
			</p>
			<p>My final year undergraduate project was selected as the entry
				by the CIS department for the 2015 Scottish young software engineer
				of the year award. This project would form the basis of my PhD
				proposal, as it looked at a new system to solve GVGP problems. The
				work I did got me 3rd place in the competition.</p>
			<h3>2014</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Awarded a Technical Student position with CERN</b>
			</p>
			<p>During my time at cern, I developed Machine Protection
				software for the particle accelerators there, including the Large
				Hadron Collider. I learned a wide variety of software development
				methodologies and used my time there to discover a bit more about
				myself and different cultures from around the world.</p>
